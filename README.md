## Delivering news of absolutely nought value.

A small single page javascript news app that parses real news articles using the Guardian API.
It then summarises and displays the articles using Aylien API.


## Set Up
(We're assuming you're on a mac, vaguely know what you're doing and that you have homebrew installed. Install [homebrew here](https://brew.sh/). This isn't overly helpful but we've been learning for only 7 weeks so be gentle)

### Install Node

This cracking installation needs Node.
In your terminal run:
```
  brew install node
```

### Download Required Node Packages

```
  cd file/location/of/napkin-notes
  npm install
```

### Start the local server
```
node beNoughty
```
### Open in your browser
Check Out:

http://localhost:6969/
```
and Voila! Useless news for your delectation!
